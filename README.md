# Mask_Detection_project
It is rightly said that "Necessity is the mother of all inventions". The aim of this project is to detect people who are not wearing face masks and ring an alarm on detecting such people.
This project uses a deep learning model which takes images of people's faces and predict whether they are wearing masks or not.
